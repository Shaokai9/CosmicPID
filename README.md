Aim to find better way to select Signal based on Tree-Based algorithms.
First, using Adaptive Boosting and its variants to build the additive models; 
Second, introdcuing Tree-Based Auto Machine Learning Frameworks;
Third, applying XGBoost and LightGBM on NOvA simulated data to express their classification power.
